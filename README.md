Analysis of French PhD Theses â€“ R Notebook

This project explores over 448,000 French PhD theses, offering insights into academic trends, languages, supervision patterns, and discipline evolution. Using R, I analyzed, cleaned, and visualized the dataset to reveal meaningful patterns and provide a deeper understanding of the French doctoral landscape over several decades.

Project Overview

The goal of this project was to extract actionable insights from a large and complex dataset. I focused on:
- How theses are distributed across disciplines and years
- The languages in which theses are written and how they evolved over time
- The distribution of supervision and identification of the most active PhD advisors
- Patterns in thesis defenses across months and years
By combining rigorous data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, this notebook provides a comprehensive picture of French academic output.

Key Skills & Techniques

- Data wrangling & cleaning: Handling missing data, standardizing text fields, creating new variables
- Statistical analysis: Summarizing large datasets, calculating proportions, identifying top contributors
- Data visualization: Line plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and interactive visualizations using ggplot2, pheatmap, and heatmaply
- Time-series analysis: Tracking trends over decades, including language evolution and seasonal defense patterns

Insights & Highlights

- Identification of trends in thesis defenses by month and year, showing seasonal patterns and changes over time
- Discovery of the top 1% of supervisors responsible for over 10% of theses
- Analysis of language usage, revealing shifts from predominantly French theses to more bilingual and English theses in recent years
- Visualization of missing data to ensure data quality and reliability

Why This Project Matters

This analysis demonstrates the ability to handle large, complex datasets, derive insights, and present findings in a clear, interpretable way. It combines data science, statistical modeling, and visualization skills to answer meaningful questions about the academic research landscape, making it a great showcase of applied analytics in the social sciences and education fields.
